MuniMap
=======
MuniMap is a great way for you to access the nextmuni.com information.

The problem before was that you had to navigate the klunky non-mobile optimized, non-native web interface, and non-location aware interface which made life difficult. With MuniMap, you are given all of the nearby muni bus stop locations.
